# 👋 Hi, I'm Antigones

🎓 Developer, curious researcher and (wannabe) science communicator.
I explore **unconventional computing** and **algorithms** mixing **math models**, **graph theory**, **microcontrollers** and a bit of **retrocomputing** to build bridges between disciplines that aren’t supposed to meet.


## 💡 Areas of Interest
- 🧠 **Emergent Computation** — simulations inspired by natural systems like L-Systems, *Physarum polycephalum* or cellular automata.
- 🧮 **Algorithms & Structures** — from maze generation to Tower of Hanoi, N-Queens and emoji worlds production (sometimes with a quantum twist).
- 🧩 **Quantum Computing** — experiments with *Qiskit*, custom Grover oracles and generative art.
- 🔌 Arduino & ESP32 projects.
- 💾 **Retro Computing** — vintage software exploration.
- 📚 **Education & Science Communication** — creating content to make complex concepts accessible.


## 🧪 Featured Projects
- **Mazes** – generating mazes with algorithms, formal grammars and ML (GANs/PixelCNN++).
- **Emoji worlds** - using Wave Function Collapse algorithm and Grover oracles to generate emoji worlds.
- **Physarum Polycefalum Simulation** – Collective exploration algorithm inspired by slime mold behavior.
- **Solving river crossing puzzles with RL** – Using Reinforcement Learning to solve river crossing puzzles.


## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools
- 🐍 Python / Qiskit / MicroPython
- ⚡  Arduino /ESP32 / BLE
  

## 📹 Science Communication
I create **short educational videos** about programming, unusual algorithms and computing curiosities, exploring questions like:  
- *"What is a tUrmite?"*
- *"What if code could take a selfie?"*
- *"Does culture influence how we count and code?"*


## 💡 What I like to do
I enjoy **connecting abstract ideas with tangible systems**, turning equations into code and code into stories.  
Sometimes that means finding strange ways to get a goat, a wolf and a cabbage across a river; other times, it means making a slime mold teach me about optimization.
